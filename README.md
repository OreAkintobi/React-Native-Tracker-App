### What this is.

This is a cross-platform (iOS + Android) app built with React Native, Expo CLI, Axios and a server I created with MongoDB & Express. That server is [here](https://github.com/OreAkintobi/React-Native-Tracker-App-Express-Server "here").

### How to Use

- First of all, please make sure to clone and start the Express server repository for this app [here](https://github.com/OreAkintobi/React-Native-Tracker-App-Express-Server "here") before continuing with this repository.

- Clone this repo and open in command line.

- Make sure you have the [Express server](https://github.com/OreAkintobi/React-Native-Tracker-App-Express-Server "Express server") running and the correct link from ngrok is placed in the jsonServer file of this project.

- Run `yarn install` in the project folder to install all the required dependencies.

- Run `yarn start` to open the expo project window in your browser and run the app on your emulator or mobile device
